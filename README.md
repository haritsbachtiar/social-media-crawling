[Project Name]
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for. Explain the main purpose and functionality in a couple of sentences.

üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8+: This project requires a modern version of Python. You can check your version by running:

python --version

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and running.

Clone the repository

First, clone the project to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repository-name].git
cd [your-repository-name]

Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated. We'll use Python's built-in venv module.

On macOS and Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

On Windows:

python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing dependencies, you need to activate the virtual environment.

On macOS and Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows (Command Prompt):

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On Windows (PowerShell):

venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt.

Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install all the required packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Once the setup is complete, you can run the main script of the project.

# Example: Running the main application file
